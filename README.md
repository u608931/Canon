## Regulation in the taxi market 
This part is constructed as follows. First, we will describe the market failures that form the foundation of regulation in the taxi industry. Second, we will provide information on the regulatory instruments that are used in the taxi industry. Third, problems associated with regulation will be discussed.
  
An unregulated taxi market faces market failures that provide reason for regulation. Among these, important failures are: the absence of perfect price competition, excess entry, asymmetric information regarding quality and congestion externalities.  
  
* Perfect price competition will not prevail in an unregulated taxi market. In an unregulated market, operators could set their prices separately. The perfect competitive outcome would predict that an operator that undercuts his rivals would extract additional sales from his rivals. In reality, this might not be the case. The problem is that consumers cannot observe the different prices of all operators easily. Therefore, it would be costly for consumers to search for the cheapest taxicab. These costs include the time that passes before finding the cheapest offer, as well as the psychological cost of declining offers.   
* Open entry to the taxi market could lead to an excessive supply of independent operators. Low entry costs and the opportunity of self-employment could lead to persistent over-supply in the taxi market.  
* Some aspects of taxicab quality are unobservable for consumers. For example, it is fairly difficult, if not impossible for consumers to observe the competence of the driver ex ante. So, there is asymmetric information regarding the characteristics of the taxi service.   
* Taxis are a considerable source of road traffic congestion. For example, there are approximately 485000 taxi trips in New York per day. Obviously, the enormous amount of taxi rides contributes to traffic congestion.  
  
To counter these market failures, taxi markets are often heavily regulated. Price control, entry regulation and quality regulation are frequently used policy instruments.  
  
* To counter the inadequacy of price competition, prices are often controlled by means of metering. The regulated price is a function consisting of a fixed cost plus a variable part related to distance and time of a taxi ride.
* To control for the excess entry result, entry is widely regulated by means of limitation. Usually, a distribution of mandatory licenses or medallions is used. This regulation could also temper the congestion externalities.
* Quality regulation is used to solve the problems regarding asymmetric information regarding quality. Distribution and suspension of licences is used to maintain high quality services.  
  
Many taxi markets that were first heavily regulated, later faced deregulations. This stems from problems associated with regulation in the taxi market. Important problems are discussed below.  
  
* Regulation of the taxi market is very time-consuming and difficult, especially in contrast to the economic activity that it generates. Regulatory instruments may not be able to solve the problems associated with a free market. For example, quality regulation might not be able to solve asymmetric information problems.
* Taxi operators are often very politically active. They lobby for entry regulations and price regulation that increases prices. Customers are poorly organized, so their preferences are underrepresented in regulation.  
  
These problems can lead to regulatory capture, in which the regulation favours the interests of the regulated industry above the interests of its consumers.  
  
As shown, the taxi industry is heavily regulated. Additional information on regulation in the taxi industry can be found [here](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/transport/de-regulation-of-the-taxi-industry_9789282101155-en#page1). Regulated industries sometimes face the competition of new entrants in spite of heavy regulations, as is the case in the taxi industry. Uber challenges the regulations in the taxi industry and it potentially changes the entire structure of the industry. The next section will discuss the rise and the implications of the entrance of Uber in detail.














## The big picture.
In this section, we will show that the case of Uber in the Taxi market can be representative of new entrants facilitated by technological progress, introducing competition into other regulated markets or markets with barriers to entry. Uber is part of a wider newly emerging sector referred to as the sharing or collaborative economy. This new sector involves using technology to link demand with supply of underutilized assets mostly from individuals rather than firms. To date, the European commission has been enthusiastic in encouraging the progress of the collaborative economy as a way to enhance competition in the single market and increase economic activity in the area. However it acknowledges that there are areas where regulation needs to be introduced on this sector such as taxation, liability and the employment status of those providing their assets and/or services. 

This new movement has the capacity to challenge incumbents in markets that previously had been suffering from entry barriers and excessive regulation such as the taxi market as discussed in this canon. However, the taxi market is not the only one to have been effected by the emergence of this new technology, the most notable example of which being Airbnb as a challenger to the hotel industry where large fixed costs and heavy advertising may be prohibitive to new entrants. Airbnb allows individuals to advertise spare rooms or beds they have on a website to those interested in a short stay. Both Airbnb and Uber could be described as operating in a parallel market than the hotel and taxi markets respectively but it is very clear that both have the potential to introduce effective competition to the market.

The problem here is that while they have the potential to disrupt the status quo of these markets, the fact that they do not face the same regulations as the incumbents provides the likes of Uber with a significant advantage over the taxi drivers. If allowed this could lead to regular taxi drivers becoming uncompetitive and thus leaving the market. Uber, Lyft or whatever other provider or drivers with cars in the city could then be left in a dominant position in the market, especially given the network effects in the industry. Therefore it is vital that these new competitors in the collaborative economy are also regulated and not allowed to either enter freely or banned from entering the market. In this way new and effective forms of competition while at the same time consumers are protected both from excessive prices due to competition and unnecessary dangers due to safety and quality regulations. 


## Conclusion.

In this canon we have discussed heavily regulated markets and have used the ride sharing platform Uber as a case study of how the rise of new entrants can challenge incumbents in these markets by bypassing the entry barriers imposed by regulation using technology. The taxi market was used as an example due to the heavy regulatory pressure placed on it in many jurisdictions and because of the well documented rise of Uber and the upset it has caused in many markets around the world. 
The main reasons requiring regulation in the taxi market we argued are that perfect price competition will not prevail in an unregulated market, without limits on the number of operators there would be excessive supply of taxis and elements of the quality of driver are unobservable to the customers, and therefore price, quality and supply limit regulations are put in place. Recently there has been a trend of deregulation due to the fact that it is very costly to regulate the taxi market and political economy reasons. For insights into the new ridesharing market we provided a brief history of Uber and the effect that the company is currently imposing on the market. 

As a final note to policy makers it is our view that policy and regulations should be implemented in a way as to enhance the workings of the market for taxis and ridesharing and not to protect the dominant position of the drivers. Operators in the collaborative economy should be allowed to operate in the market although their operations should not be unfettered and they should not be given an unfair advantage over the incumbents, or we run the risk of replacing one inefficient market structure with another.
